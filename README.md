# DBMS Lab

This repository contains lab assignments for Database Management Systems (DBMS), organized by core database concepts. Each assignment number is tagged in the filenames for quick identification and mapping.

## Structure

- **schema-design** *(Assignment 1)*  
  Table definitions and data population scripts.

- **querying-techniques** *(Assignment 2)*  
  Data selection, projection, joins, and aggregate operations.

- **subqueries** *(Assignment 3)*  
  Implementations of nested and correlated subqueries.

- **database-objects** *(Assignment 4)*  
  Use of views, indexes, and sequences for efficient data management.

- **procedural-sql** *(Assignment 5)*  
  Stored procedures and functions using PL/SQL.

- **control-structures** *(Assignment 6)*  
  Handling flow control with cursors and exception mechanisms.

- **triggers** *(Assignment 7)*  
  Automating actions using database triggers.

## Usage

Run each `.sql` script in a supported SQL environment like Oracle SQL Developer. Ensure the required schema is set up before execution.

## Notes

- Scripts are structured by concept, not by syllabus sections.
- PL/SQL-specific scripts are best run on Oracle DBMS.
